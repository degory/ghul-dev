# type narrowing

::: tip editable examples
Every example on this page can be edited and run here: click the pencil to open it in an editor, change it, and run it in your browser. Errors, hovers and completions come from the ghūl compiler as you type.

The [ghul-examples repository](https://github.com/degory/ghul-examples/tree/main/examples/type-inference) has fuller examples that include narrowing, to build and run locally, in a GitHub Codespace or a dev container.

When a check proves a value has a more specific type, ghūl narrows the value for the code the check covers: inside the branch, the value has the narrower type, with no cast and no unwrap needed. Union variant tests, `isa` class checks, presence tests on optionals, and `if let` all narrow, and narrowing follows the control flow, [covered below](#flow-sensitive-narrowing).

::: tip narrowing inlays
Open ghūl in an editor with the [ghūl language extension](/tooling.html) and small triangle hints mark where type narrowing changes: `►` where a variable is narrowed to a more specific type, `◄` where a narrowing ends and the variable widens back to its declared type, and `◄►` where an assignment does both at once. Hovering a hint shows the types and the reason; on an `if` it shows the narrowing for both the taken and the not-taken branch. The same sigils appear in the code examples on this site.

## narrowing in a condition

An `isa` test in an `if` condition narrows the variable to the tested type inside the then-branch. This holds for a union variant or a class:

<GhulExample name="control-flow-8" />

An [optional type](/optional-types) narrows the same way. A `?` test in the predicate narrows the optional to its non-optional form in the then-branch, so the value can be used directly:

<GhulExample name="control-flow-9" />

For a two-variant union, the `else` branch is narrowed to the complementary variant:

<GhulExample name="control-flow-10" />

The `else` narrowing extends to a class hierarchy declared in the current assembly without `open`: the compiler knows every subclass, so ruling out the tested one narrows the `else` branch to the others, and when an `abstract` root has exactly two subclasses, ruling out one leaves the other. The [object oriented programming](/object-oriented-programming) page covers open, closed, and abstract classes.

A `while` condition narrows its body the same way an `if` condition narrows its then-branch, so `while isa CAT(a) do a.purr() od` reaches a `CAT`-only member without an inner cast.

## flow-sensitive narrowing

Narrowing follows the control flow, not just the branch structure. A common shape is a guard: when the test fails, the guard leaves the block with `return`, `throw`, `break` or `continue`, so the code after the guard runs only when the test passed, and the value is narrowed there:

<GhulExample name="control-flow-11" />

## locals and parameters

Narrowing applies to local variables, including a function's own parameters.

<GhulExample name="type-inference-3" />

## fields and properties

Narrowing also applies to a member-access path like `x.field` or `x.property`. A presence test (`?`) narrows the path: after `if x.field? then`, uses of `x.field` inside the branch are non-optional.

<GhulExample name="type-inference-4a" />

An `isa` check or variant test narrows a path the same way:

<GhulExample name="type-inference-4" />

## narrowing on assignment

Reassigning a local narrows it: when the new value's static type is more specific than the declared type, the local narrows to that type from the assignment on, so a following call resolves on the assigned type without an `isa`:

<GhulExample name="control-flow-57" />

If the local is already narrowed, assigning a value of a different type cancels that narrowing and introduces one for the new type, so the following call resolves on the assigned type:

<GhulExample name="control-flow-56" />

## when a narrowing ends

A narrowing lasts until the end of the code block associated with the test, unless it is invalidated sooner, for example by call to another function that could cause its type to change.
