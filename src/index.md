#  ghÅ«l programming language

![Hero Image](ghul-logo-draft.png)

(Note: this site is very much a **work-in-progress**. The [ghÅ«l compiler](https://github.com/degory/ghul) is currently the definitive ghÅ«l language reference)

## why ghÅ«l?

Why not ðŸ¤”

ghÅ«l is mainly an opportunity for [me](https://github.com/degory) to experiment with programming language design. Apart from a slightly quirky syntax, ghÅ«l is a fairly conventional programming language. Although ghÅ«l is a hobby project maintained by a single person, its goal is to be sufficiently expressive for general-purpose development: the [ghÅ«l compiler](https://github.com/degory/ghul) itself is written in ghÅ«l.

## features

- **type safety**: ghÅ«l enforces type safety at compile-time.

- **functional programming elements**: ghÅ«l supports function literals, including anonymous functions, lambdas, and closures.

- **OOP**: ghÅ«l supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and other Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

- **error handling**: the language includes try/catch/finally for error handling.

- **generics**: ghÅ«l types, methods, and functions can have generic type parameters.

- **.NET integration**: ghÅ«l targets .NET, producing and consuming NuGet packages and supporting inter-operation with other .NET languages.

## examples

### hello world!

```ghul
entry() =>
    IO.Std.write_line("hello world"); 
```

### functional

```ghul
use IO.Std.write_line;

entry() is
    let add = (x: single, y: single) => x + y;
    let subtract = (x: single, y: single) => x - y;
    let multiply = (x: single, y: single) => x * y;
    let divide = (x: single, y: single) => x / y;

    let calc = (x: single, y: single, operation: (single, single) -> single) => operation(x, y);

    let a = 10.0;
    let b = 5.0;

    write_line("Addition: " + calc(a, b, add));
    write_line("Subtraction: " + calc(a, b, subtract));
    write_line("Multiplication: " + calc(a, b, multiply));
    write_line("Division: " + calc(a, b, divide));
si
```

### OOP
```ghul
use IO.Std.write_line;

class Calculator is
    init() is
    si

    add(x: single, y: single) -> single is
        return x + y;
    si

    subtract(x: single, y: single) -> single is
        return x - y;
    si

    multiply(x: single, y: single) -> single is
        return x * y;
    si

    divide(x: single, y: single) -> single is
        if y != 0.0 then
            return x / y;
        else
            throw new System.DivideByZeroException("Error: Division by zero");
        fi
    si
si

entry() is
    let calc = new Calculator();

    let a = 10.0;
    let b = 5.0;

    write_line("Addition: " + calc.add(a, b));
    write_line("Subtraction: " + calc.subtract(a, b));
    write_line("Multiplication: " + calc.multiply(a, b));
    write_line("Division: " + calc.divide(a, b));
si
```
