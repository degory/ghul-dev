![ghÅ«l programming language logo](ghul-logo-draft.png)

(Note: this site is very much a **work-in-progress**. The [ghÅ«l compiler](https://github.com/degory/ghul) source code is currently the definitive ghÅ«l language reference)

## why ghÅ«l?

Why not ðŸ¤”

ghÅ«l is mainly an opportunity for [me](https://github.com/degory) to experiment with programming language design. Apart from a slightly quirky syntax, ghÅ«l is a fairly conventional programming language. Although ghÅ«l is a hobby project maintained by a single person, its goal is to be sufficiently expressive for general-purpose development: the [ghÅ«l compiler](https://github.com/degory/ghul) itself is written in ghÅ«l.

## features

- **type safety**: ghÅ«l enforces type safety at compile-time.

- **functional programming elements**: ghÅ«l supports anonymous functions with closures.

- **OOP**: ghÅ«l supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and other Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

- **error handling**: the language includes try/catch/finally for error handling.

- **generics**: ghÅ«l types, methods, and functions can have generic type parameters.

- **.NET integration**: ghÅ«l targets .NET, producing and consuming NuGet packages and supporting inter-operation with other .NET languages.

## examples

### hello world!

```ghul
entry() =>
    IO.Std.write_line("hello world"); 
```

### functional

```ghul
use IO.Std.write_line;

entry() is
    // lazily generates an infinite sequence of fibonacci numbers:
    let fibonacci_sequence = generate(
        (0, 1),
        state: (int, int) =>
            let 
                (prev, current) = state,
                next = prev + current
            in
                ((current, next), next)
    );

    // lazily generates an infinite sequence of factorials:
    let factorial_sequence = generate(
        (1, 1),
        state: (int, int) =>
            let
                (p, prev) = state,
                n = p + 1,
                next = prev * n
            in
                ((n, next), next)            
    );

    write_line("first 10 fibonacci numbers: {fibonacci_sequence | .take(10)}");
    write_line("first 10 factorial numbers: {factorial_sequence | .take(10)}");
    write_line("first 10 even fibonacci numbers: {fibonacci_sequence | .filter(x => x % 2 == 0) .take(10)}");

    for (i, (fib, fact)) in fibonacci_sequence | .zip(factorial_sequence) .take(10) .index() do
        write_line("fibonacci {i} is {fib}");
        write_line("factorial {i} is {fact}");
    od;
si
```

### OOP
```ghul
use IO.Std.write_line;

class CALCULATOR is
    init() is
    si

    add(x: single, y: single) -> single =>
        x + y;

    subtract(x: single, y: single) -> single =>
        x - y;

    multiply(x: single, y: single) -> single =>
        x * y;

    divide(x: single, y: single) -> single =>
        if y != 0.0 then
            x / y;
        else
            throw System.DivideByZeroException("oops: division by zero");
        fi;
si

entry() is
    let calc = CALCULATOR();

    let a = 10.0;
    let b = 5.0;

    write_line("Addition: {calc.add(a, b)}");
    write_line("Subtraction: {calc.subtract(a, b)}");
    write_line("Multiplication: {calc.multiply(a, b)}");
    write_line("Division: {calc.divide(a, b)}");
si
```
