When a check proves a value has a more specific type, ghūl narrows the value for the code the check covers: inside the branch, the value has the narrower type, with no cast and no unwrap needed. Union variant tests, `isa` class checks, presence tests on optionals, and `if let` all narrow, and narrowing follows the control flow, [covered below](#flow-sensitive-narrowing).

> **narrowing inlays**
>
> Open ghūl in an editor with the [ghūl language extension](https://ghul.dev/tooling.html) and small triangle hints mark where type narrowing changes: `►` where a variable is narrowed to a more specific type, `◄` where a narrowing ends and the variable widens back to its declared type, and `◄►` where an assignment does both at once. Hovering a hint shows the types and the reason; on an `if` it shows the narrowing for both the taken and the not-taken branch. The same sigils appear in the code examples on this site.

## narrowing in a condition

An `isa` test in an `if` condition narrows the variable to the tested type inside the then-branch. This holds for a union variant or a class:

```ghul
…
union Maybe[T] is
    YES(value: T);
    NO;
si
…
let m: Maybe[int] = Maybe.YES(42);

if isa Maybe.YES( ► m) then
    // m is narrowed to Maybe.YES inside the branch,
    // so m.value is in scope
    write_line("got value {m.value}");
fi

let a: Animal = CAT("whiskers");
if isa CAT( ► a) then
    // a is narrowed to CAT inside the branch
    write_line(a.purr());
fi
```

output:

```
got value 42
whiskers purrs
```

An [optional type](https://ghul.dev/optional-types) narrows the same way. A `?` test in the predicate narrows the optional to its non-optional form in the then-branch, so the value can be used directly:

```ghul
…
let name: string? = lookup();

if ► name? then
    // name is narrowed to non-optional string
    // here, no ! needed
    write_line("hello, {name}");
fi
```

output:

```
hello, world
```

For a two-variant union, the `else` branch is narrowed to the complementary variant:

```ghul
…
union Result[T, E] is
    OK(value: T);
    ERR(error: E);
si
…
let r: Result[int, string] = some_call();

if isa Result.OK( ► r) then
    write_line("ok: {r.value}");
else
    // r is narrowed to Result.ERR here
    write_line("err: {r.error}");
fi
```

output:

```
ok: 42
```

The `else` narrowing extends to a class hierarchy declared in the current assembly without `open`: the compiler knows every subclass, so ruling out the tested one narrows the `else` branch to the others, and when an `abstract` root has exactly two subclasses, ruling out one leaves the other. The [object oriented programming](https://ghul.dev/object-oriented-programming) page covers open, closed, and abstract classes.

A `while` condition narrows its body the same way an `if` condition narrows its then-branch, so `while isa CAT(a) do a.purr() od` reaches a `CAT`-only member without an inner cast.

## flow-sensitive narrowing

Narrowing follows the control flow, not just the branch structure. A common shape is a guard: when the test fails, the guard leaves the block with `return`, `throw`, `break` or `continue`, so the code after the guard runs only when the test passed, and the value is narrowed there:

```ghul
…
classify(a: Animal) is
    if !isa CAT( ► a) then
        write_line("not a cat");
        return;
    fi

    // every non-CAT has returned, so a is
    // narrowed to CAT from here on
    write_line(a.purr());
si

classify(CAT("whiskers"));
classify(DOG());
```

output:

```
whiskers purrs
not a cat
```

## locals and parameters

Narrowing applies to local variables, including a function's own parameters.

```ghul
…
greet(a: Animal) is
    if isa CAT( ► a) then
        // a is a parameter of greet, narrowed to CAT
        // in this branch
        write_line(a.purr());
    fi
si

greet(CAT());
```

output:

```
purr
```

## fields and properties

Narrowing also applies to a member-access path like `x.field` or `x.property`. A presence test (`?`) narrows the path: after `if x.field? then`, uses of `x.field` inside the branch are non-optional.

```ghul
…
describe(order: ORDER) is
    if ► order.customer? then
        // a presence test narrows the path itself:
        // within this branch order.customer is the
        // non-optional string, so .length is
        // reachable directly
        write_line("customer name has {order.customer.length} chars");
    fi
si

describe(ORDER("alice"));
```

output:

```
customer name has 5 chars
```

An `isa` check or variant test narrows a path the same way:

```ghul
…
class CARRIER(occupant: Animal);
describe(carrier: CARRIER) is
    if isa CAT( ► carrier.occupant) then
        // carrier.occupant is a CAT within this branch,
        // so its purr() is reachable directly
        write_line(carrier.occupant.purr());
    fi
si

describe(CARRIER(CAT()));
```

output:

```
purr
```

## narrowing on assignment

Reassigning a local narrows it: when the new value's static type is more specific than the declared type, the local narrows to that type from the assignment on, so a following call resolves on the assigned type without an `isa`:

```ghul
…
► pet = CAT();
// assigning a CAT narrows pet to CAT, so purr() is in reach
write_line(pet.purr());
```

output:

```
purr
```

If the local is already narrowed, assigning a value of a different type cancels that narrowing and introduces one for the new type, so the following call resolves on the assigned type:

```ghul
…
if isa CAT( ► pet) then
    write_line(pet.purr());

    ◄► pet = DOG();
    // reassigning cancels the CAT narrowing and
    // introduces a DOG one: pet is DOG here
    write_line(pet.name());
fi
```

output:

```
purr
dog
```

## when a narrowing ends

A narrowing lasts until the end of the code block associated with the test, unless it is invalidated sooner, for example by call to another function that could cause its type to change.
