To minimize latency for functions like code completion, the first recompilation after an edit is partial: the edited files are fully compiled, but the rest of the project is only compiled up to the global definitions. The bodies of functions, methods, and properties in unedited files are not compiled during this phase. The extension then waits longer, and if no further edits occur, it requests a full compilation of the entire project.
